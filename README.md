In this demonstration, I used Microsoft Azure Cloud to setup a domain controller and a client virtual machine to interact with the domain controller. This can be seen here  <a href="https://youtu.be/3EPa4qw4P1k?t=55">Click Here</a>
Once we have active directory setup on the domain controller, we will create various files on the c: drive and gave them various permissions and see if we can log in to them in the current state. Once we estabilshed our boundaries, we will give our client permission to access various folders by changnng the user status within then security groups that we establish in active directory.
